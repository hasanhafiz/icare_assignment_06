Assignment 6: Static portfoliio site

This week's assignment is to: "Build your static portfolio site using Laravel".
Set up your development environment and Install a fresh Laravel application.
Use Laravel’s Routing, Controller, View to build your static portfolio website

## Features

There will be the following pages in your portfolio site:
- Home
- Work experiences
- Projects (Clicking on each project will open a new page with the project details)

## Note:
- Don’t use Database
- Keep your data in JSON files in the 'storage/data' folder and load them before serving the pages
- The webpage design is not the priority in this assignment. You can simply copy any HTML template to design the site or you can build the design by yourself using HTML, and CSS.
